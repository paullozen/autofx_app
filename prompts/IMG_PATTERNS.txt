Chalk;Generate a minimalist digital illustration featuring an off-white stick figure with a solid off-white head, drawn with clean lines. The main character has facial experession and wears a black cap and a black jacket layered over a white hoodie, with realistic folds and subtle shading. The background features faint chalk writings, diagrams, and notes, softly blurred and partially erased, symbolizing ideas and learning. Use clean composition and strong symmetry. The mood should feel reflective, calm, and intellectually focused.The color palette is monochrome and cool-toned — mainly blacks, grays, and off-whites — with touches of soft blue light to add depth. But add some color on the chalk drawings. The overall tone is cinematic and introspective, evoking the atmosphere of deep focus and contemplation. Style: minimalistic, stylized, cinematic. Lighting: cool soft backlight with subtle rimlight and deep contrast. Mood: reflective, disciplined, thoughtful.
Noir-Chalk;Minimalist figures with clean off-white lines, but dropped inside a world drowned in 70–80% black ink. The stick-figure wearing the black cap and jacket over a white hoodie—folds soft, stylized, lightly shaded—while the rest of the scene collapses into harsh noir contrast. A single brutal backlight cuts a cold rim around the character, carving sharp highlights into the darkness. Cross-hatching fills the mid-tones, stippling softens transitions, and diagonal shadows slice through the frame. Few Chalk writings and symbols float behind the figure—some blurred, some half-erased—now carrying subtle pops of real color: faint reds, yellows, and blues glowing like thoughts refusing to die. Corners fall into a heavy vignette, architecture drawn with rigid ink lines, emotions leaking through messy strokes. Yellow accents stay under 10%—small on main focus of the scence. Mood: reflective but haunted, disciplined but cracking, intellect grinding against inner shadow. Style: minimalistic, cinematic, chalk-meets-ink nightmare of focus and doubt.
Noir;Cross-hatched mid-tones with varied line density, heavy black ink swallowing 70–80% of the frame, white paper carving harsh highlights. One brutal light source—top, side, or back—cutting the scene into jagged light and suffocating shadow. Diagonal energy everywhere. Corners sink into a black vignette. Figures drawn with expressive strokes: tight and anxious or bold and confident. Stippling for quiet transitions. Architecture in rigid lines, emotions in messy ones. Yellow accents under 10%, thin and deliberate—eyes, fingertips, or a fleeting thought—glowing like a tiny rebellion against all the darkness.
Acrylic;Acrylic Painting Style with Fast-drying layers with crisp edges and sharp transitions. Colors appear bold, saturated, and flexible—capable of both opaque blocking and thin, watercolor-like washes. Brushstrokes can shift quickly: smooth blends, textured impasto, or flat graphic fields depending on technique. Surfaces build through layered glazing or heavy body strokes, creating depth without the slow drying of oils. Highlights pop strongly due to acrylic’s brightness; shadows stay clean and defined. Mood: versatile, modern, energetic—ideal for expressive experiments, graphic clarity, or complex layered compositions.
M2C;a minimalist mini white stick figure with a large expressive round head. The top of the head is a smooth bowl opened, with perfectly rounded edges and no cracks. Inside, a bright purple cartoon-style brain with soft, defined folds, glowing with a purple light and small sparkles floating above it. Hoodie styled exactly like the reference: navy blue on top and teal at the bottom, with the red-and-white "M2C" (M in red and 2C in white) logo on the chest. Clean line-art style, smooth gradients, simple shapes. Black minimalist pants. Mascot-like. Laptop around. White background. Hunching Stick Figure, hands on head. The purple glowing brain shows visible cracks, and its light is flickering/failing.
